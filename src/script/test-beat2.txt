    Well, that was a disaster.
    Okay, we've got a lot of work to do.
    What just happened?!

    M
    That was terrible!
    What are we going to do?!
    We need to get out of here!

    J
    I guess that went alright.

    M
    We're stars!

J
We just need to focus on what do next.
Okay, let's just move forward.
Be quiet and let me think.

M
Right!
Okay!
Whatever.

J
Just let bygones be bygones.
Let's not focus on whose fault this is.
Even though this whole situation is your fault.

M
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?!
You're the one who did the thing with the stuff!

J
I seem to recall that you lost the script.
    !lostscript
You dropped the computer in the toilet!
    !toiletcomputer
You didn't even tell me we had a show booked until yesterday morning!!
    !forgotshow

M
Well I respectfully disagree with your version of events.
That's not how it happened!
Oh, you wanna play it like that, do ya?!

J
And then you just started reciting Hamlet!
    ?hamlet
And then you got on stage and stood there!
    ?silent

M
What about you?
You've got some answering to do yourself!
J'accuse!

J
What do you mean?
Do tell!
This should be good!

M
You... drank that witch's potion!
You... got hit in the head by that pigeon!
You... got food poisoning from that chicken sandwich!

M
And then you were asleep for 5 days!
And then you had amnesia for 2 weeks!
And then you vanished for a month!

J
None of that happened.
You're making all of that up!
Morro, you're being ridiculous!

M
Fine!
I don't care!
Talk to the hand!!

    J
    Listen, none of this matters right now!
    Let's just talk about what to do next.
    Let's just fix this play and get out of here, okay?

    M
    I suppose.
    Very well.
    Fine. But you haven't heard the last of me!

anger=high(
    J
    I am NOT continuing this play with you!
    Arrrgh! I can't do this!
    If that's the way you want it, let's just get out of here!

    M
    Fine with me!
    I'm twenty-one steps ahead of you!
    Let's blow this popsicle stand!
